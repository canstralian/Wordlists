## Uses

### Direct Use

**Canstralian/Wordlists** is intended for direct application in security testing scenarios, where users can employ the wordlists to evaluate password strength and resilience against common attacks.

### Downstream Use [optional]

These wordlists can be integrated into security testing tools, training programs, and educational platforms focused on cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

### Out-of-Scope Use

The wordlists are not intended for malicious purposes or unauthorized access to systems.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

While the wordlists are curated for efficacy, they may contain biased or outdated terms. Users should evaluate the appropriateness of the wordlists for their specific contexts.

### Recommendations

Users should be aware of the ethical implications and limitations of using these wordlists. It is recommended to combine them with updated and context-specific data to ensure robust security practices.

## How to Get Started with the Model

To start using **Canstralian/Wordlists**, you can implement the following code snippet to load a wordlist:

```python
import requests

wordlist_url = "https://huggingface.co/Canstralian/Wordlists/resolve/main/wordlist.txt"
response = requests.get(wordlist_url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    wordlist = response.text.splitlines()
    print("Loaded wordlist with", len(wordlist), "entries.")
else:
    print("Failed to load wordlist.")
```

## Training Details

### Training Data

The wordlists were compiled from publicly available datasets, security forums, and community contributions to ensure a comprehensive and useful collection for security testing.

### Training Procedure

No formal training was conducted, as this is a curated dataset. Instead, the focus was on the selection and validation of wordlist entries.

#### Preprocessing [optional]

Wordlist entries were filtered to remove duplicates and irrelevant terms, ensuring clarity and effectiveness.

#### Training Hyperparameters

- **Training regime:** N/A

#### Speeds, Sizes, Times [optional]

- **Total Size:** Approximately 50MB
- **Number of Entries:** Over 1,000,000 entries across various categories

## Evaluation

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

The utility of the wordlists was evaluated using common security testing scenarios and brute-force attack simulations.

#### Factors

Evaluation factors include the coverage of common passwords and phrases, uniqueness of entries, and adaptability to different testing environments.

#### Metrics

- **Coverage:** Measures the extent to which the wordlists contain relevant terms.
- **Completeness:** Assesses the thoroughness of the wordlists in different contexts.
- **Uniqueness:** Evaluates the diversity of entries to minimize redundancy.

### Results
